# Results: Changes in How Policy Documents Address Distributive Justice {#cj-results}

## Are final rules more likely to address climate change or climate justice after comments do so?

<!--Figure \@ref(fig:cj-PR-winrate-1) shows that, in general, -->

Where climate change or climate justice is not addressed in the draft rule, a higher percent of rules add climate justice language when comments raise climate justice concerns. Descriptively, there is a large difference in the rate of addressing climate change between rules where commenters did (17 percent) and did not raise climate change (1 percent). There is a similar difference in the rate of addressing climate justice between rules where commenters did (14 percent) and did not raise climate or climate justice (1 percent). However, in most cases (86 percent), agencies did not respond at all when commenters raised climate justice concerns.

```

Rates of adding climate justice in rules without climate justice comments have decreased over time, leveling out at 3 percent during the Obama and Trump presidencies. Rates of adding climate justice when commenters raised climate justice concerns are consistently much higher but also decreased over time, from 57 percent under G.W. Bush to 26 percent under Trump.
<!--Finally, looking at selected agencies, Figure \@ref(fig:cj-PR-winrate-2) shows that-->
The Forest Service and Fish and Wildlife Service were the only agencies to ultimately address climate change in the majority of their policies.  Most other agencies also added climate justice at a higher rate when comments raised climate justice concerns; indeed, most agencies almost never added mentions of climate change or climate justice when comments did not raise climate justice concerns.

### Estimating *Whether* "Climate Change/Justice" is Added to Final Rule
-->

To account for differences across presidents, agencies, and the number of comments, I estimate logit regressions. For Models 1 and 2 in Table \@ref(tab:cj-tables), the outcome is whether the agency added climate change to the final rule. The predictors are
whether comments raised climate justice concerns, the number of unique (non-form letter) comments addressing climate justice, the total number of comments (including form letters), and the interaction between the total number of comments and whether any comments raised climate justice concerns. Models 3 and 4 are the same as Models 1 and 2, except that the predictors relate to comments addressing climate justice, and the outcome is whether the policy text addressed climate justice. All models include fixed effects for the presidential administration and errors clustered by president. Models 2 and 4 also include fixed effects for each agency. Thus, estimates in Models 1 and 3 include variation *across* agencies, whereas estimates in Models 2 and 4 only rely on variation *within* agencies. All estimates rely on variation *within* each presidential administration. 
<!--The base equation for Model 1 is shown below.-->
All predicted probabilities shown below include agency fixed effects (Models 2 and 4).

### The Predicted Probability of Added Text

As logit coefficients are not easily interpretable, Figures \@ref(fig:cj-m-PR-president-median-1), \@ref(fig:cj-m-PR-comments-agencyFE), and  \@ref(fig:cj-m-PR-agency-top) show the predicted probability of a final rule addressing climate change/justice when the draft rule did not. 


#### By President 

Controlling for average rates of policy change per agency and the number of comments, Figure \@ref(fig:cj-m-PR-president-median-1) shows a large increase in the probability of policy change when comments raise climate justice concerns. <!--This supports the *Distributive Claims Hypothesis* (\@ref(hyp:cj-claims)).--> When comments raise distributive justice concerns, they are more likely to be addressed in the final policy. Rates of adding climate justice language decrease in the Trump Administration, but differences between presidents are small compared to the difference between rules that did and did not receive climate justice comments.  Other variables are held at their modal values: the EPA, zero additional climate justice comments, and one comment total.^[All predicted probability plots below also show probabilities at the modal values for other variables: President Obama, the EPA, zero additional climate justice comments, and the median number of total comments (one comment) unless otherwise specified.]

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "climate-m-PR-president-median-1.png"))

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "cj-m-PR-president-median-1.png"))
```


#### By Total Number of Comments 

Figure \@ref(fig:cj-m-PR-comments-agencyFE) shows the probability that an agency will add climate justice language given different total numbers of comments. 
At low numbers of total comments (i.e., low levels of public attention), a single comment raising climate change or climate justice is a strong predictor that language mentioning climate change or climate justice will be added to the final rule. For rules with less than ten comments (most rules), one comment mentioning climate justice is associated with a 10 percent increase in the probability that climate justice will be addressed in the final rule. <!--This supports the *Distributive Claims Hypothesis* (\@ref(hyp:cj-claims)). However, <!--as in figure \@ref(fig:cj-PR-winrate-1), -->
The probability that an agency will add climate change or climate justice language is still below 80 percent---even when comments raise climate justice concerns, agencies tend not to address them. 

As the number of comments increases, the probability that a rule will add text addressing climate justice increases. <!--This supports the *Public Attention Hypothesis* (\@ref(hyp:cj-attention))---> Policy change is more likely when there is more public attention to a policy process. However, for both climate change and climate justice, the effect of public attention is limited to cases where commentors are not raising these concerns. Put differently, there is a negative interaction between the number of comments and climate justice comments---the more comments, the smaller the relationship between comments raising climate justice and agencies addressing climate justice in the rule. In the small portion (less than one percent) of highly salient rules with 1,000 or more comments, the presence of comments raising climate or climate justice concerns no longer has a statistically significant relationship with agencies adding climate justice to the text. With or without climate justice comments, these rules have about the same probability of change as those with just one climate justice comment, between 10 and 20 percent. <!--This is evidence against the *Public Pressure Hypothesis* (\@ref(hyp:cj-pressure)).---> The total number of comments (i.e., the scale of public attention) matters regardless of whether these comments explicitly raise climate justice concerns. However, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:cj-comments), few rules with 10,000 or more comments do not have at least one comment mentioning climate justice, so we are highly uncertain about estimates of the impact of climate justice comments with high levels of public attention. We can be much more confident about the relationship between comments raising climate justice concerns and rule change at lower, more typical levels of public attention.

The probability of
"climate change" or "climate justice" appearing in the final rule also increases with the number of unique comments mentioning "climate change" or "climate justice" in Models 2, 3, and 4. <!--Overall, this supports the *Repeated Claims Hypothesis* (\@ref(hyp:cj-repeated-claims)). -->
The more comments raising climate change or climate justice, the more likely policymakers are to engage with and use this language.

```


#### By Number of Comments Raising Climate Concerns

Figure \@ref(fig:cj-m-PR-cj-comments-agencyFE) shows the probability that an agency will add climate justice language given the number of comments explicitly raising either climate change or climate justice. Controlling for the total number of comments (public attention or rule salience), more comments specifically raising climate change or climate justice concerns greatly increase the probability that a final rule will address climate change or climate justice. Given that many pressure campaigns mobilize over 1000 people, the difference between a rule with the modal number of comments (one) and one with a pressure campaign mobilizing 1000 people is an increase of 65% (from approximately 10 percent response rate with one comment to 75 percent with 1000 comments). 

```{r cj-m-PR-cj-comments-agencyFE, fig.cap = "Probability That Climate Change/Justice is Added Between Draft and Final Rules by Number of Comments Raising Climate or Climate Justice Concerns", out.width = "80%", fig.show = "hold"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "climate-m-PR-climatecomments-agencyFE-1.png"))

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("Figs", "cj-m-PR-cj-comments-agencyFE-1.png"))
```


Figure \@ref(fig:cj-m-PR-agency-top) shows estimated variation in rates of adding climate change and climate justice to final rules across agencies (estimating models identical to 2 and 4, but with agency indicator variables rather than fixed effects). Most agencies publish too few rules to have statistical confidence in the differences. In addition to the EPA, agencies that were significantly more likely to add text in response to comments include the Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBS), Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy (EERE), the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

Agencies with the largest average rates of adding climate justice language are the agencies we would expect to be more receptive to climate justice claims.  While many agencies make policies that could be framed as "environmental," and all policy decisions have distributive consequences, institutions have norms and procedures that lead policymakers to see problems in different ways. For example, some agencies have dedicated staff and prominent internal guidance on climate justice analysis in rulemaking, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation (which includes the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA),    Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), and  Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)). These agencies are among the most responsive to commenters raising climate justice concerns. However, differences among agencies are extremely uncertain due to the small number of rules where climate justice was added at most agencies. <!--Thus, there is more support for the *Policy Receptivity Hypothesis* (\@ref(hyp:cj-receptivity)) than against it, but differences between agencies with different missions and institutional practices regarding climate justice are not clear cut.-->

# Conclusion

Social movements play a critical role in advancing landmark statutes that recognize new rights and social values. Likewise, lack of movement pressure is a leading explanation for the failure of policy efforts. 

This paper provides uniquely systematic evidence about the impact of the climate and climate justice movements on the thousands of climate-relevant policies that governments make every year.
Leveraging a new dataset of thousands of draft and final policies and millions of public comments on these policies, I show that when public comments raise climate change or climate justice concerns, these concerns are more likely to be addressed in the final rule. Effect sizes vary across agencies, possibly due to the extent that climate change as an issue frame aligns with the institutional histories and roles in which policymakers see themselves. 

The magnitude of public pressure matters. When more groups and individuals raise climate and climate justice concerns, policy texts are more likely to change, even when controlling for overall levels of public attention. These findings suggest that distributive justice claims, levels of public attention, and levels of public pressure all systematically affect policymaking. Finally, public comments offer a new lens to assess the rise and impact of the climate justice movement within the broader environmental justice movement.


## Future research

<!--theory testing ground-->
Interest group lobbying in government agencies drives U.S. environmental policy. Yet, many leading theories of policy change remain untested in the context of agency rulemaking. Do coalitions between businesses and unions that have blocked legislative efforts on climate issues also block rulemaking? Are deregulatory interests systematically advantaged over environmental advocates in rulemaking? Does the scale of public pressure or the attention of legislators constrain interest group influence? This paper has made some initial steps toward addressing these questions. The new dataset will allow scholars to map interest groups' influence and policy ideas across agencies. 

<!--policy feedback -->
Climate policy has been fertile ground for studies of policy feedback [e.g., @Stokes2020]. Many feedback dynamics include bureaucratic policymaking, though often implicitly. When policy incentivizes groups to form or mobilize, the targets of pressure are often policymakers in the agencies tasked with crafting (and re-crafting) the specific legal requirements that give legislation specific meaning, thus distributing specific costs and benefits. Regardless of new legislation, most U.S. federal climate policy will continue to be made in the bureaucracy. The bureaucracy thus presents scholars of climate politics and policy feedback with terrain to further build and test theory.  

<!--representation --->
Future work may systematically address who participates in environmental policymaking and the societal and ideological constituencies they represent, the legal and environmental ideas at stake, and the influence of competing coalitions and ideas on policy. The knowledge gained through a systematic study of climate-relevant rulemaking will inform policy, advocacy strategies, and ongoing reforms of the rulemaking process itself.
