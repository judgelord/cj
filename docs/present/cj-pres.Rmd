# Motivation 

- Climate change affects nearly everything, but policy is inconsistently framed as "climate policy"

--

- Nearly all policies have disparate effects, but climate policy is inconsistently framed as a distributive justice ("climate justice") issue


--

- With or without landmark legislation, most U.S. climate policy will continue to be made in federal agencies

--

- A lack of public pressure is a key cause of legislative failure (Skocpol 2013)

---

# Questions

- Whom does agency rulemaking empower? 

  - Who raises climate change and climate justice issues?
  
  - Who tends to win?

- How receptive are different institutions to public pressure on climate and climate justice issues? 

  - How much does presidential support or hostility affect agency policymaking? 

  - Are bureaucracies with more experience more receptive? 

---


### If groups build the power to pass a Green New Deal, what happens when 30+ agencies write the actual policies? 

--

### Will organized public pressure carry over to agency policymaking? 
--
If so, by what mechanisms?

- General levels of public attention to policymaking?

- Specific pressure to adopt a climate justice frame?

- Which parts of government are most likely to be moved? 

---


## Preview of Findings 

- From 2005 to 2020, less than 8% of relevant agency rules addressed climate change, and only 2% addressed climate justice, despite growing activist demand

--

- 20% of all public comments mentioned climate change

--

- 20% of rules and 8% of comments mentioning climate change also mention environmental justice or climate justice

--

- Policies are more likely to change when there is more public pressure 
--
(1000 supporters = ~ 65 percentage point increase in the probability that claims will be addressed)

6 Big Green groups, along with CREDO Action and Democracy For America (Howard Dean's campaign organization), ran all campaigns raising CJ issues and mobilized nearly all CJ comments.

# Theory

Pressure campaigns bolster **technical information** (e.g., science, legal arguments) with **political information** (e.g., the number of organizations in a coalition, petition signatures, the level of public attention)


---

## Example: EPA responds to comments 

2013 Obama EPA proposed rule: *Air Quality State Implementation Plans; Approvals and Promulgations: Navajo Nation; Regional Haze Requirements for Navajo Generating Station* mentions neither climate change nor environmental justice.

In response to 421 comments raising climate justice concerns, the final rule added nine paragraphs on environmental justice and a brief mention of climate change: 

> "EPA agrees that climate change is an important issue...Although regulation of greenhouse gases is conducted under separate statutory requirements from regional haze"


<!--, EPA is mindful that this BART determination for NGS is not the only regulatory program that affects this facility and the region."-->

---

## Example: EPA ignores comments

2017 Trump EPA proposed rule: *State of Texas, Regional Haze and Interstate Visibility Transport Federal Implementation Plan* makes no mention of climate change. 
<!--
 "Texas' participation in the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule’s (CSAPR) trading program for ozone-season NOX qualifies as an alternative to BART. We are approving Texas’ determination that its EGUs are not subject to BART for particulate matter (PM)."
-->
A short EJ section mentions only SO2, not NOX or PM.

61 Comments, including EarthJustice et al.: 

> "Climate change may also have an effect on the outdoor air pollutant concentrations, especially ozone."

The final rule makes no mention of climate change and no change to the EJ section.

[EartheJustice et al.] (https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-R06-OAR-2016-0611-0083)

The EPA believes that this action does not have disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority populations, low-income populations, and/or indigenous peoples, as specified in Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994). We have determined that this rule will not have disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority or low-income populations because it increases the level of environmental protection for all affected populations without having any disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on any population, including any minority or low-income population. The rule limits emissions of SO

## Data: 39,392,957 public comments

- 45%, 17,857,018 (421,880 unique) raise "climate change"

- 8%, 3,248,697 (2,138 unique) also mention environmental justice or cimate justice

- 82% of all comments raising EJ also mention climate change, but only 14% of **unique** comments raising EJ also mention climate change

## To sum up, yes, movements matter (even when victories are rare)

<!--| 📢x✊🏿 Specific (Conditional) Pressure            | 📉 | ❓ | -->

With larger coalitions and more public attention, agencies are more likely  📈 to **add** EJ language **where there was none**<!--, BUT agencies also anticipate public attention, making **existing** EJ analyses less likely 📉 to **change** on higher-salience rules.-->

### Thank you!

- Paper, slides, data: [judgelord.github.io/research/ej](judgelord.github.io/research/cj)

- Rules related to Climate and EJ currently open for comment: [judgelord.github.io/rulemaking/open]( https://judgelord.github.io/rulemaking/open)

--

### Next Steps

- More on coalition structure and policy success, especially opposing coalitions
- Better (hand-coded) measures of policy change
- Model changes in texts that already discuss climate/EJ/CJ
- Additional terms (e.g., "warming") and analysis of change in term frequency
- Better estimation
